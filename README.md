# Google Meet Clone

THis is a google meet clone where we can create simple meetings, and a max of 3 users can join meeting. It has a simple UI. The tech stacks used are:

1. **Frontend:** React
2. **Backend:** ws library
3. **WebRTC:** Clients made by Peer.js

In the other branch there is no meeting logic and only pure inhouse built webRTC connections. Tried to deploy backend on AWS but then couldn't make the websocket connections due to absence of certificates and a domain. So for now the backend is hosted on render.com and frontend on vercel.
